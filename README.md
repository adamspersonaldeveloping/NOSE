# My Awesome Project
Choosing a color can be difficult if you are indecisive like me, so this app takes the stress away from choosing because it will choose a color randomly for you!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

In order to create this, I worked in a team with the above mentioned to create a random color picker. The html and css is basic so that the colors can be the center of attention. The JavaScript is used to display the colors and the Node.js is used to find a random color.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*
I would optimize this project by including more colors for the random selection. Some of the JavaScript could also be refactored to be more streamlined so that the randomization could work faster and the display color might load a factoin of a second faster.


## Lessons Learned:
Working in a group can be challenging, but having a clear goal and timeline for the project to be completed helped make creating this project with others easier. Having a clear goal and not going into the project like an accident helped a lot.
